### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap] (https://getbootstrap.com/) - Bootstrap5

### What I learned

I built this project with help of Bootstrap 5. It was easier by not using Bootstrap but I wanted a go and try it out. It was fun and learned a lot about of customization of the default bootstrap codes.
